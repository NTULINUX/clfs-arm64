- check why mount failed:
    [    2.055758] EXT4-fs (vda): couldn't mount as ext3 due to feature incompatibilities
    [    2.099060] EXT4-fs (vda): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)
    [    2.100419] VFS: Mounted root (ext4 filesystem) readonly on device 254:0.
- run test cases. i.g. ltp, lava
- run android ?
